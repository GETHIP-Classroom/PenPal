		<p>Need help perfecting your grammar? Can’t remember <br>
	 	  which rules apply to which words? Here are some tips <br>
	  	 and tricks to avoid many of the most frequently<br>
	  	 committed word crimes.</p>
	
		<h3>Grammar</h3>
		
			<p>Your and You’re: Your is possessive, you’re (you are).<br>
			   Ex. Your brain is sharp if you’re able to know which one to use.<br>
                  	 Their, There, and They’re: Their is possessive, there is pointing, <br>
                 	  and they’re (they are.)<br>
		  	 Ex. There is their dog, and they’re very happy. <br>
                  	 Effect and Affect: Effect is almost always a noun while affect is<br>
                	   almost always a verb<br>
		  	 Ex: If you affect the effect, you are effective.</p>

		<h3>Proper Citations</h3>
	
			<ul><h4>MLA 8: Citation</ul></h4><br>
			   <ol>
				   <li>Author</li>
				   <li>Title of the Source</li>
				   <li>Title of the Container</li>
				   <li>Other Contributors</li>
				   <li>Version</li>
				   <li>Numbers</li>
				   <li>Publisher</li>
				   <li>Publication Date</li>
				   <li>Location</li>
				   <li>Ex. book citation:
		   	 	  	Goodwin, Doris. Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln. Simon & Schuster, 2012.</li>
	           	</ol>

		<ul><h4>MLA 8: Paper Format</ul></h4><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Use white 8 ½  x 11” paper.</li>
				<li>Make 1 inch margins on the top, bottom, and sides</li>
				<li>The first word in every paragraph should be indented one half inch.</li>
				<li>Indent set-off quotations one inch from the left margin</li>
				<li>Use any type of font that is easy to read, such as Times New Roman. Make sure that italics look different from the regular typeface</li>
				<li>Use 12 point size</li>
				<li>Double space the entire research paper, even the works cited page.</li>
				<li>Leave one space after periods and other punctuation marks, unless your instructor tells you to make two spaces.</li>
				<li>Use an MLA header</li>
			</ol>

		<ul><h4>MLA 8: Header Format</ul></h4><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Begin one inch from the top of the first page and flush with the left margin.
				<li>Type your name, your instructor’s name, the course number, and the date on separate lines, using double spaces between each.  Ex:<br>
				Jane Smith<br>
				Mr. Paul Williams<br>
				11 August 2017 (make sure this is the date the paper is DUE)<br>
				<li>Double space once more and center the title. Do NOT underline, bold, or type the title in<br> all capital letters. Only italicize words that would normally be italicized in the text. 
				<br>Example: Character Development in The Great Gatsby.</li>
				<li>Do not place a period after the title or after any heading.</li>
				<li>Double space between the title and first lines of the text.</li>
				<li>Placed in the upper right-hand corner, one half inch from the top, flush with the right margin.</li>
				<li>Type your last name before the page number. (To make this process easier, set your<br> word processor to automatically add the last name and page number to each page).</li>
				<li>Do not place p. before the page number.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<ul><h4>APA: Title Page</ul></h4><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Running head</li>
				<li>Title</li>
				<li>Author name</li>
				<li>School affiliation</li>
			</ol></p>
	
		<ul><h4>APA: Abstract</ul></h4><br>
			An abstract is a brief summary of your paper that immediately follows your title page. According<br>
			to APA format, your abstract should be no more than <u>150 to 250 words</u> although this can vary<br>
			depending upon the specific publication or instructor requirements.
			</p>

		<ul><h4>APA: The Main Body</ul></h4><br>
			For something like an essay, the main body of your paper will include the actual essay itself. If<br>
			you are writing a lab report, then your main body will be broken down into further sections. The<br>
			four main components of a lab report include an introduction, method, results, and discussion<br>
			sections.
			</p>

		<ul><h4>APA: References</ul></h4><br>
			The reference section of your paper will include a list of all of the sources that you used in your<br>
			paper. If you cited any piece of information anywhere in your paper, it needs to be properly<br> referenced in this section. One handy rule of thumb to remember is that any source cited in your<br>
			paper needs to be included in your reference<br> section, and any source listed in your reference section must also be mentioned somewhere in your paper
			</p>

		<ul><h4>APA: Paper Format</ul></h4><br>

				<li>Make 1 inch margins on the top, bottom, and sides</li>
				<li>The first word in every paragraph should be indented one half inch.</li>
				<li>Indent set-off quotations one inch from the left margin</li>

				<li>Last edited date</li>

				<li>Resource retrieved</li>

			</ol></p>

		
		<h3>Story Elements</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Cliches: An idea that has been overused. To avoid them, take a common trope and find <br>
			a clever way to subvert it.</li>
			<li>Character Arc: When a character goes through a transformation or inner journey <br>
			throughout the story. By the end, each character should be somewhere different than <br>
			where they started mentally.</li>
			<li>Time Jumps: A time jump is when an amount of time, whether a couple of hours or a <br> 
			couple of years, are skipped and replaced with a short transition. These are necessary <br>
			when nothing significant happens within that period of time.</li>
