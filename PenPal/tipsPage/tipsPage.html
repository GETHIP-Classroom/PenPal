	<p>Need help perfecting your grammar? Can’t remember <br>
	   which rules apply to which words? Here are some tips <br>
	   and tricks to avoid many of the most frequently<br>
	   committed word crimes.</p>

	<h3>Grammar</h3>
		
		<p>Your and You’re: Your is possessive, you’re (you are).<br>
		   Ex. Your brain is sharp if you’re able to know which one to use.<br>
                   Their, There, and They’re: Their is possessive, there is pointing, <br>
                   and they’re (they are.)<br>
		   Ex. There is their dog, and they’re very happy. <br>
                   Effect and Affect: Effect is almost always a noun while affect is<br>
                   almost always a verb<br>
		   Ex: If you affect the effect, you are effective.</p>

	<h3>Proper Citations</h3>
	
		<p><ul>MLA 8: Citation</ul><br>
		   <ol>
			   <li>Author</li>
			   <li>Title of the Source</li>
			   <li>Title of the Container</li>
			   <li>Other Contributors</li>
			   <li>Version</li>
			   <li>Numbers</li>
			   <li>Publisher</li>
			   <li>Publication Date</li>
			   <li>Location</li>
			   <li>Ex. book citation:
		   	   	Goodwin, Doris. Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln. Simon & Schuster, 2012.</li>
	           </ol></p>

		<p><ul>MLA 8: Paper Format</ul><br>
		<ol>
			<li>Use white 8 ½  x 11” paper.</li>
			<li>Make 1 inch margins on the top, bottom, and sides</li>
			<li>The first word in every paragraph should be indented one half inch.</li>
			<li>Indent set-off quotations one inch from the left margin</li>
			<li>Use any type of font that is easy to read, such as Times New Roman. Make sure that italics look different from the regular typeface</li>
			<li>Use 12 point size</li>
			<li>Double space the entire research paper, even the works cited page.</li>
			<li>Leave one space after periods and other punctuation marks, unless your instructor tells you to make two spaces.</li>
			<li>Use an MLA header</li>
		</ol></p>

		<p><ul>MLA 8: Header Format</ul><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Begin one inch from the top of the first page and flush with the left margin.
			<li>Type your name, your instructor’s name, the course number, and the date on separate lines, using double spaces between each.  Ex:<br>
			Jane Smith<br>
			Mr. Paul Williams<br>
			11 August 2017 (make sure this is the date the paper is DUE)<br>
			<li>Double space once more and center the title. Do NOT underline, bold, or type the title in<br> all capital letters. Only italicize words that would normally be italicized in the text. 
			<br>Example: Character Development in The Great Gatsby.</li>
			<li>Do not place a period after the title or after any heading.</li>
			<li>Double space between the title and first lines of the text.</li>
			<li>Placed in the upper right-hand corner, one half inch from the top, flush with the right margin.</li>
			<li>Type your last name before the page number. (To make this process easier, set your<br> word processor to automatically add the last name and page number to each page).</li>
			<li>Do not place p. before the page number.</li>
		</ul></p>

		<p><ul>APA: Title Page</ul><br>
		<ol>
			<li>Running head</li>
			<li>Title</li>
			<li>Author name</li>
			<li>School affiliation</li>
		</ol></p>
	
		<p><ul>APA: Abstract</ul><br>
		An abstract is a brief summary of your paper that immediately follows your title page. According<br>
		to APA format, your abstract should be no more than <ul>150 to 250 words</ul> although this can vary<br>
		depending upon the specific publication or instructor requirements.
		</p>

		<p><ul>APA: The Main Body</ul><br>
		For something like an essay, the main body of your paper will include the actual essay itself. If<br>
		you are writing a lab report, then your main body will be broken down into further sections. The<br>
		four main components of a lab report include an introduction, method, results, and discussion<br>
		sections.
		</p>

		<p><ul>APA: References</ul><br>
		The reference section of your paper will include a list of all of the sources that you used in your<br>
		paper. If you cited any piece of information anywhere in your paper, it needs to be properly<br> referenced in this section. One handy rule of thumb to remember is that any source cited in your<br>
		paper needs to be included in your reference<br> section, and any source listed in your reference section must also be mentioned somewhere in your paper

	<h3>Story Elements</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Cliches: An idea that has been overused. To avoid them, take a common trope and find <br>
		a clever way to subvert it.</li>
		<li>Character Arc: When a character goes through a transformation or inner journey <br>
		throughout the story. By the end, each character should be somewhere different than <br>
		where they started mentally.</li>
		<li>Time Jumps: A time jump is when an amount of time, whether a couple of hours or a <br> 
		couple of years, are skipped and replaced with a short transition. These are necessary <br>
		when nothing significant happens within that period of time.</li>
