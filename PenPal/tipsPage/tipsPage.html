		<p>Need help perfecting your grammar? Can’t remember <br>
	 	  which rules apply to which words? Here are some tips <br>
	  	 and tricks to avoid many of the most frequently<br>
	  	 committed word crimes.</p>
	
		<h3><ul>Grammar</ul></h3>
		
			<p>  Your and You’re: Your is possessive, you’re (you are).<br>
			     Ex. Your brain is sharp if you’re able to know which one to use.<br>
                  	   Their, There, and They’re: Their is possessive, there is pointing, <br>
                 	    and they’re (they are.)<br>
		  	   Ex. There is their dog, and they’re very happy. <br>
                  	   Effect and Affect: Effect is almost always a noun while affect is<br>
                	     almost always a verb<br>
		  	   Ex: If you affect the effect, you are effective.</p>

		<h3>Proper Citations</h3>
	
			<h4><ul>MLA 8: Citation</ul></h4>
			   <ol>
				   <li>Author</li><br>
				   <li>Title of the Source</li><br>
				   <li>Title of the Container</li><br>
				   <li>Other Contributors</li><br>
				   <li>Version</li><br>
				   <li>Numbers</li><br>
				   <li>Publisher</li><br>
				   <li>Publication Date</li><br>
				   <li>Location</li><br>
				   <li>Ex. book citation:<br>
		   	 	  	Goodwin, Doris. Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln. Simon and Schuster, 2012.</li>
	           	</ol><br>

		<h4><ul>MLA 8: Paper Format</ul></h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Use white 8 ½  x 11” paper.</li><br>
				<li>Make 1 inch margins on the top, bottom, and sides</li><br>
				<li>The first word in every paragraph should be indented one half inch.</li><br>
				<li>Indent set-off quotations one inch from the left margin</li><br>
				<li>Use any type of font that is easy to read, such as Times New Roman. Make sure that italics look different from the regular typeface</li><br>
				<li>Use 12 point size</li><br>
				<li>Double space the entire research paper, even the works cited page.</li><br>
				<li>Leave one space after periods and other punctuation marks, unless your instructor tells you to make two spaces.</li><br>
				<li>Use an MLA header</li>
			</ol>

		<h4><ul>MLA 8: Header Format</ul></h4><br>
				&bull; Begin one inch from the top of the first page and flush with the left margin.</li>
				&bull; Type your name, your instructor’s name, the course number, and the date on separate lines, using double spaces between each.  Ex:<br>
				Jane Smith<br>
				Mr. Paul Williams<br>
				11 August 2017 (make sure this is the date the paper is DUE)<br>
				&bull; Double space once more and center the title. Do NOT underline, bold, or type the title in all capital letters. Only italicize words that would normally be italicized in the text. 
				<br>Example: Character Development in The Great Gatsby.<br>
				&bull; Do not place a period after the title or after any heading.<br>
				&bull; Double space between the title and first lines of the text.<br>
				&bull; Placed in the upper right-hand corner, one half inch from the top, flush with the right margin.<br>
				&bull; Type your last name before the page number. (To make this process easier, set your word processor to automatically add the last name and page number to each page).<br>
				&bull; Do not place p. before the page number.

			<h4><ul>APA: Title Page</ul></h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Running head</li><br>
				<li>Title</li><br>
				<li>Author name</li><br>
				<li>School affiliation</li><br>
			</ol>
	
		<h4><ul>APA: Abstract</ul></h4>
			An abstract is a brief summary of your paper that immediately follows your title page. According<br>
			to APA format, your abstract should be no more than <u>150 to 250 words</u> although this can vary<br>
			depending upon the specific publication or instructor requirements.

		<h4><ul>APA: The Main Body</ul></h4>
			For something like an essay, the main body of your paper will include the actual essay itself. If<br>
			you are writing a lab report, then your main body will be broken down into further sections. The<br>
			four main components of a lab report include an introduction, method, results, and discussion<br>
			sections.

		<h4><ul>APA: References</ul></h4>
			The reference section of your paper will include a list of all of the sources that you used in your<br>
			paper. If you cited any piece of information anywhere in your paper, it needs to be properly<br> referenced in this section. One handy rule of thumb to remember is that any source cited in your<br>
			paper needs to be included in your reference<br> section, and any source listed in your reference section must also be mentioned somewhere in your paper

		<h4><ul>APA: Paper Format</ul></h4>

				<li>Use white 8 ½  x 11” paper.</li><br>
				<li>Make 1 inch margins on the top, bottom, and sides</li><br>
				<li>The first word in every paragraph should be indented one half inch.</li><br>
				<li>Indent set-off quotations one inch from the left margin</li><br>

			</ol><br>

		<h4><ul>APA: Citations</ul></h4>

				<li>Contributors' names</li><br>
				<li>Last edited date</li><br>
				<li>Title of resource</li><br>
				<li>Resource retrieved</li><br>
				<li>Ex: TOLSTOY, L. (2017). WAR AND PEACE. S.l.: OXFORD UNIV PRESS</li>
			</ol><br>
		
		<h4><ul>Story Elements</ul></h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Cliches: An idea that has been overused. To avoid them, take a common trope and find
			a clever way to subvert it.</li><br>
			<li>Character Arc: When a character goes through a transformation or inner journey
			throughout the story. By the end, each character should be somewhere different than
			where they started mentally.</li><br>
			<li>Time Jumps: A time jump is when an amount of time, whether a couple of hours or a 
			couple of years, are skipped and replaced with a short transition. These are necessary
			when nothing significant happens within that period of time.</li><br>
		</ol>
